In [**Chirpy**](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/), the image files of [Favicons](https://www.favicon-generator.org/about/) are placed in `assets/img/favicons/`. You may need to replace them with your own. So let's see how to customize these Favicons.

With a square image (PNG, JPG or GIF) in hand, open the site [*Favicon & App Icon Generator*](https://www.favicon-generator.org/) and upload your original image.
