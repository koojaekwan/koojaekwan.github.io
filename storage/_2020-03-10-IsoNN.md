   - graph classification

     - **estimate the usefulness of subgraph features**

       - feature evaluation criterai based on both labeld and unlabeld graphs (2010)
       - pattern exploration appraoch based on pattern co-occurence  (2009, 2014)
       - but) based on BFS, DFS -> computing problem

     - **After Deep learning era,**

       - learn implicit structual features

         - MPNN (2017)

         - GCN (2016)

         - but) explicit structual information NO RESEARCH

           

         - aggregation of node features as the graph representation (2018, 2017)

         - but) simply doing aggregation cannot caputre substructure precisiely

         

         - model with capturing subgraphs (2017, 2017)
         - but) computation complex (2017, 2017)

     - **node-orders**

       - (adjacency) matrix naturally poses a redundant constraint on the graph node-order
       - may render the learning performance
